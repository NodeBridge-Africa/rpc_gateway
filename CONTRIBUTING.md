## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use TypeScript with strict typing and ESLint for code quality:

```bash
# Check code style
yarn lint

# Auto-fix style issues
yarn lint:fix

# Type checking
yarn type-check
```

**Style Guidelines:**

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Use async/await over Promises where possible

### Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

**Test Categories:**

- **Unit Tests**: For utility functions and pure logic
- **Integration Tests**: For API endpoints and workflows
- **Database Tests**: For model operations
- **Metrics Tests**: For Prometheus integration

**Testing Guidelines:**

- Maintain >90% test coverage
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Write descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Include edge case testing

### Commit Convention
