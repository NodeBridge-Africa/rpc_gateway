# Ethereum Node Endpoints (Examples - Actual routing depends on App's chain configuration)
# These might be used for general health checks or specific internal system features,
# but are NOT the primary means of routing user RPC requests for their Apps.
# The actual node URLs for specific chains are now managed via the Admin API
# and stored in the 'chains' collection in the database.

# Default Rate Limiting for Apps
# DEFAULT_APP_MAX_RPS is defined as a constant in src/config/constants.ts (currently 20 RPS).
# This value is used as the default when a new App is created.
# DEFAULT_DAILY_REQUESTS applies per App API key, limiting total requests for that app in a 24h period.
DEFAULT_DAILY_REQUESTS=10000

# Optional: Admin User Setup (for initial setup script or manual creation)
# ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com

# CORS_ALLOWED_HEADERS=Content-Type,Authorization

# Logging Level (Optional - examples: 'info', 'debug', 'warn', 'error')
# LOG_LEVEL=info

# Maximum number of apps a user can create
# This is currently managed as a hardcoded constant in app.controller.ts (5)
# If you wish to make it configurable via .env, you would need to modify the controller
# USER_MAX_APPS=5
